# automated-customized-deep-neural-networks
The purpose of this project is to have a library for deep networks to automatically builds deep neural networks with customized architecture given the specific parameters and features. 

There are 5 classes with different base architectures including simple Deep Neural Network, Autoencoders, Hybrid Neural Network (which is a combination of autoencoder and classifier), Convolutional Neural Network, and Convolutional Autoencoder (which also has the option to be a hybrid network if you set the number of outputs to two).

These classes are placed in the neural_network.py folder. Further, more detailed explanations and individual usage are included in the train_and_test_models.ipynb.
